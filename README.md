## 1. Understanding the Assignment

- **Read the instructions thoroughly** to grasp all requirements.
- **Identify deliverables**:
  - Google Doc with descriptions and links
  - Presentation (PPT or Google Slides)
  - Prompt Spreadsheet with three tabs
  - Resume in the Google Drive folder

## 2. Create a Google Drive Folder

- **Create a new folder** in Google Drive.
- **Name the folder appropriately**, e.g., `Work Sample Assignment - [Your Name]`.
- **Set sharing permissions** to allow `read access` via a link.
- **Upload your resume** into this folder.

## 3. Select an Educational Topic

Choose one topic from the following:

1. Introduction to Electronics in HVAC
2. Use of Analog Electronics in Today's World
3. Innovative Use of Sensors and Actuators
4. Applications of Thermodynamics in Mechanical Engineering

**Action**: Select the topic you are most comfortable with.

## 4. Create the Course Outline

- **Develop an outline** for the chosen topic.
- **Structure**:
  - **Topics**
    - **Subtopics**
      - **Learning Objectives** for each subtopic

**Tips**:

- Ensure learning objectives are clear and measurable.
- Use bullet points for clarity.

## 5. Design Prompts for Different LLMs

- **Select at least three LLMs** (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini).
- **Create tailored prompts** for each LLM to generate:
  - Course outline
  - Slide content
  - Visual learning aids

**Considerations**:

- Leverage each LLM's strengths.
- Ensure prompts are clear and align with learning objectives.

## 6. Utilize Prompt Engineering Tools

- **Choose prompt engineering tools** such as:
  - OpenAI Playground
  - PromptPerfect
  - AI Dungeon

**Steps**:

- Use these tools to **refine and enhance your prompts**.
- **Document** how each tool assists in improving the prompts.

## 7. Generate and Compare Outputs

- **Use the prompts** with the selected LLMs to generate content.
- **Apply various prompting techniques**:
  - Zero-shot prompting
  - Few-shot prompting
  - Chain-of-thought
  - Prompt chains

**Actions**:

- **Collect outputs** from each LLM.
- **Analyze and compare** the outputs.
- **Document strengths and weaknesses** based on your experience.

## 8. Optimize Prompts

- **Review the outputs** and identify areas for improvement.
- **Refine your prompts** to:
  - Improve clarity
  - Reduce ambiguity
  - Enhance engagement

**Document** the changes made to the prompts and the reasoning behind them.

## 9. Prepare the Presentation

- **Select the best outputs** for the presentation.
- **Create slides** that include:
  - Explanation or narration text
  - Visual learning aids (images, infographics, animations, or videos)

**Ensure** the presentation aligns with the learning objectives and is engaging.

## 10. Compile Submission Documents

- **Google Doc**:
  - Describe each step taken.
  - Provide links to all generated outputs.
- **Prompt Spreadsheet**:
  - **Tab 1**: Three prompts for each required output.
  - **Tab 2**: Information on prompt engineering tools used and their benefits.
  - **Tab 3**: Your experiences with each LLM, including strengths and weaknesses (based on personal experience, not online sources).

## 11. Final Review and Submission

- **Review all documents** for completeness and adherence to instructions.
- **Ensure clarity and professionalism** in all materials.
- **Check sharing settings** on the Google Drive folder.
- **Submit** the assignment before the deadline.

## Additional Tips
